title: Use for instead of each
---

The use of native JavaScript functions nearly always results in faster execution than the ones in jQuery. For this reason, instead of using the `jQuery.each` method, use JavaScript's own `for` loop.

But pay attention, even though `for in` is native, in many cases it performs worse than `jQuery.each`.

And the tried and tested `for` loop gives us another opportunity to speed things up by caching the length of collections we're iterating over.

```js
for ( var i = 0, len = a.length; i < len; i++ ) {
	e = a[i];
}
```

The use of reverse `while` and reverse `for` loops is a hot topic in the community and are frequently cited as the fastest form of iteration. However it's typically avoided for being less legible.
