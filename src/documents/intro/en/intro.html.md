    <p>And what if we got together a bunch of experts who work on large sites to create a definitive front-end performance guide?</p>

    <p>And not just one of those boring guides made for robots, what if we did something fun? What about getting together Briza Bueno **(Americanas.com)**, [Davidson Fellipe](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe) (Globo.com), [Giovanni Keppelen](https://github.com/keppelen) (ex-Peixe Urbano), [Jaydson Gomes](https://github.com/jaydson) (Terra), [Marcel Duran](https://github.com/marcelduran) (Twitter), [Mike Taylor](https://github.com/miketaylr) (Opera), [Renato Mangini](https://github.com/mangini) (Google) e [Sérgio Lopes](https://github.com/sergiolopes) (Caelum) to make the best reference possible? </p>

    <p>That's exactly what we've done! And we'll guide you in this battle to create even faster sites.</p>
