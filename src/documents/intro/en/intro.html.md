And what if we got together a bunch of experts who work on large sites to create a definitive front-end performance guide?

And not just one of those boring guides made for robots, what if we did something fun? What about getting together [Briza Bueno](http://www.brizabueno.com/) *(Americanas.com)*, [Davidson Fellipe](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe) *(Globo.com)*, [Giovanni Keppelen](https://github.com/keppelen) *(ex-Peixe Urbano)*, [Jaydson Gomes](https://github.com/jaydson) *(Terra)*, [Marcel Duran](https://github.com/marcelduran) *(Twitter)*, [Mike Taylor](https://github.com/miketaylr) *(Opera)*, [Renato Mangini](https://github.com/mangini) *(Google)*, and [Sérgio Lopes](http://sergiolopes.org) *(Caelum)* to make the best reference possible?

That's exactly what we've done! And we'll guide you in this battle to create even faster sites.
